# Data for [dev3map](https://dev3map.github.io/)

- `cities.json`: location and size of cities
- `claims.json`: boundary, name, shown color of nations
- `transit.json`: railway stations and connections ("edges")

Claim positions coordinates are in `z,x` order, because Leaflet uses the `lat,long` standard.
